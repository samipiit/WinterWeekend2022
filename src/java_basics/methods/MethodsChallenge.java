    CHALLENGE
    Create a class called “Calculator”. Within the class, you need to define 4 methods: one for addition,
    one for subtraction, one for multiplication, one for division.

    Each of these methods needs to be parameterized and do what they say.
    You can choose to have the methods return a value or just perform the operation & print out the result.

    Lastly, call those 4 methods from another class, in the main method.

    TIME NOW: 2:20
    END TIME: 2:30
